# Movie-app-enhance: Mood-Based Movie Filter Prototype

## Overview

The **Mood-Based Movie Filter Prototype** is a design project aimed at simplifying the movie selection process for users. The goal was to create an intuitive interface that allows users to find movies based on their current mood, without the frustration of browsing endless options. This exercise follows a structured process of wireframing, testing, iteration, and refinement to ensure that the final design meets user needs and is easy to use.

### Objective
- **Simplify Movie Selection**: Create a mood-based filter that offers movie recommendations tailored to the user's current emotional state.
- **User Experience Focus**: Make the filter intuitive, easy to use, and visually clear.
- **Iterate Based on Feedback**: Refine the design based on user testing to ensure optimal usability.

## Process

The project was divided into several phases:

### 1. Initial Wireframes (V1)
The first phase involved creating wireframes to define the structure of the user interface. These wireframes were minimal and functional, focusing on key elements:
- A simple mood selection interface.
- Display of movie recommendations after a mood was selected.

### 2. User Testing (V1)
User testing was conducted with five participants to gather feedback on the designâ€™s usability. The main goals of this test were:
- To assess how easily users could select their mood.
- To evaluate the effectiveness of the movie recommendations.
- To identify any usability issues in the initial wireframe.

### 3. Iteration Based on Feedback (V2)
Based on the feedback from user testing, several changes were made to improve the prototype:
- **Limited Moods**: The list of moods was restricted to simplify the choices and avoid overwhelming the user.
- **Personalized Mood Option**: A feature was added allowing users to input and select a custom mood.
- **Hover Descriptions**: Added hover tooltips that explain each mood and provide movie examples for better guidance.
- **Refresh Button**: A button was included to refresh the movie recommendations after a mood selection.

### 4. Second Round of User Testing (V2)
A second round of user testing was conducted to validate the changes made in the V2 prototype. The goals were:
- To confirm that the improvements addressed the pain points identified in the first test.
- To assess whether the mood descriptions and refresh button enhanced the user experience.
- To verify that the new design was clearer and more intuitive.

## Deliverables

The following deliverables are included in this project:

1. **Wireframes**: 
   - **V1 (Initial)**: The first iteration of the mood-based filter wireframes.
   - **V2 (Final)**: The improved version of the wireframes after user feedback and iteration.

2. **Test Protocol Documents**: 
   - **V1 Test Protocol**: The document outlining the initial testing procedure.
   - **V2 Test Protocol**: The updated test protocol for the second round of user testing.

3. **Feedback and Report Documents**:
   - **User Feedback Report**: Insights from user testing with a list of improvements made based on feedback.
   - **Iteration Report**: A report outlining the changes made to the design, the results from the second round of testing, and the final conclusions.

## Key Features of the Final Prototype

1. **Mood Selection**: Users can choose a mood from a predefined list or input a custom mood.
2. **Hover Tooltips**: Hovering over a mood shows a description and example movies that match that mood.
3. **Refresh Button**: Allows users to refresh movie recommendations based on their selected mood.
4. **User-Centered Design**: Each design decision was made with user feedback to ensure the final product is intuitive and engaging.

## Conclusion

This exercise was an opportunity to practice design thinking, wireframing, user testing, and iterative improvement. By focusing on user feedback and continuously refining the prototype, we were able to create a simple, effective solution that enhances the movie selection experience for users.
